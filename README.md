# Thread reply ban teeth

Supports extending thread reply bans into full thread-bans, but optionally disabling the following functionality in a thread someone is reply banned from;
- Edits
- Deletes
- Reactions
- Thread reply bans
- Threadmarks
- Thread edits

Will display if a user is XF banned or reply-banned via a banner on the user's post. 
This can be controlled via the option "Display thread reply banned banner on user's posts".
Note; this feature required an additional (cheap) select query.
